== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I see the message "There are no shipping methods available" in the cart/checkout page, what should I do? =

I have no clue what is happening on your server during the WooCommerce doing the shipping calculation, and there are too many possibilities to guess that can cause the shipping method not available. To find out the causes and the solutions, please switch to “ON” for the WooCommerce Shipping Debug Mode setting. Then open your cart/checkout page. You will see a very informative and self-explanatory debug info printed on the cart/checkout page. Please note that this debug info only visible for users that already logged-in/authenticated as an administrator. You must include this debug info in case you are going to create a support ticket related to this issue.
